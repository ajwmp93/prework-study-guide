# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I created this project to help keep my notes together and to be able to have quick access to update them as the class progresses. I wanted to hve a central location that all of the notes would live throughout the course without having to constantly switch folders and files on another desktop or laptop. This website allows me to quickly add new topics and notes to existing topics in one centralized location. In the process of creating this website alone, I learned coding, JavaScript, Git, CSS, and HTML language.
